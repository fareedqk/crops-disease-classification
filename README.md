# Crop Disease Classification using Transfer Learning

This project utilizes transfer learning with popular pre-trained deep learning models such as **VGG19**, **ResNet-50**, and **ConvNext** for classifying crop diseases. By fine-tuning these state-of-the-art models, we can accurately classify various crop diseases based on images, offering a powerful tool for early disease detection in agriculture.

## Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Implements transfer learning using pre-trained models such as:
  - VGG19
  - ResNet-50
  - ConvNext
- **Image Classification**: Classifies images into different categories of crop diseases.
- **Pre-trained Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tunes large-scale models on a custom crop disease dataset.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves high classification accuracy by leveraging the strength of deep learning architectures.

## Models Used

- **VGG19**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) with 19 layers, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
- **ResNet-50**: A 50-layer deep residual network known for its skip connections that mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.
- **ConvNext**: A modern CNN architecture that builds on the strengths of previous models while improving efficiency and accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of crop images that are categorized based on the type of disease.
